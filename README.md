# Module 1: The Basics of Data

*Introduction*

Data analytics is a subject that transcends industry boundaries with skills like Machine Learning, Data Visualization and narrative crafting are no longer exclusive to data scientists and analysts.

It is vital to recognize that the domain of data analytics can be branched into 2 primary components:

****conceptual understanding of data(theoretical aspect)****

****hands-on manipulation of data(practical aspect)****

Both components can operate independently but the aim is to extract actionable insights and valuable information from data. Achieved through many ways, be it coding, low-code platforms or no-code solutions.

in this module: we will learn about:

1. The role of a Data Analyst and the scope of data analytics.

2. The process of data analytics

3. The techniques of data analytics.

4. Role of data governance



# Chapter 1: The Data Analyst


**What is Data Analytics?**


Virtually organizations collect large quantities of data about its customers, products, employees and service offerings.
Managers seek to analyze that data and harness the information it contains to improve the efficiency, effectiveness and profitability of their work.

The role of a data analyst is to transform raw data into actionable insights that guide decision-making processes within an organization. It involves several key responsibilities and skills.

1. **Data Collection and Preparation:**

   * Sourcing data from various channels, including databases, spreadsheets and external sources.
  
   * Cleaning and organization the data to ensure it is accurate, consistent and ready for analysis.

2. **Data Analysis:**

   * Employing statistical methods, machine learning techniques or other analytical tools to interpret data.

   * Identifying trends, patterns and correlations that might not be immediately obvious.

3. **Data Visualization and Storytelling:**
   
   * Creating visual representations of data such as graphs, charts and dashboards to make the complex information easily understandable.
  
   * Articulating findings in a compelling narrative to communicate the significance of data to stakeholders.
     
4. **Decision Support:**

   * Making recommendations based on data-driven insights to help guide business decisions.
  
   * Providing context around data including potential implications and future trends.

5. **Collaboration and Communication:**

   * Working closely with other departments to understand their needs and provide insights.
  
   * Effectively communicating complex data findings in a clear and concise manner to non-technical stakeholders.
  
6. **Continuous Learning and Adaptation:**

   * Keeping up-to-date with the latest industry trends, tools and technologies in data analysis.
  
   * Adapting to new types of data and analytical methods as the organization's needs evolve.
  
By fulfilling these roles, a data analyst helps an organization make informed decisions that can improve operational efficiencies, drive business strategies and create a competitive advantage. The goal is to have a hand in the organization's success by turning data into a valuable asset that informs and drives decision-making.

Data analyst is used to predict future sales or purchasing behaviours, to help and protect against fraud, analyze effectiveness of campaigns, boost customer acquisition and retention

5 steps a data analyst would take when approaching a project:

1. Define questions. take a problem to formulate a hypothesis.

2. Collect data from primary sources or internal, secondary or external sources.

3. Clean the data and prepare it for analysis.

4. Analyze the data: regression, cluster and time analysis.

5. interpret and share results


***World of Analytics***

Three major pillars that allow analytics programs to thrive

1. **Data**

In 2010, the total data stored was estimated at 5 exabytes.
Today, data is created daily at a rate exceeding the total information existing in 2010.
By 2025, the data generated is projected to reach 200 zettabytes (vastly exceeding earlier estimates).
The example of WhatsApp messages highlights this growth - daily messages would create a paper stack reaching over a million kilometers high annually.
The vast amount of data creates a huge opportunity for data analytics to extract valuable insights.

2. **Storage**

3. **Computing Power**

how Moore's Law and advancements in data storage have revolutionized data analytics.

Moore's Law: Predicted doubling of computing power every two years, making it cheaper and more accessible.
Increased Storage Availability: Data can now be stored cheaply, allowing for vast amounts to be retained for analysis.
Cloud Computing: Provides access to immense computing power on-demand and at low cost.
These factors combined create a perfect environment for data analytics to flourish.
